JOSEPH MWANGI:
I am a multidisciplinary technology professional whose work sits at the intersection of data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and backend engineering. With a strong foundation in Data Science and Data Analytics, I specialize in transforming complex, raw datasets into meaningful insights that drive strategic decision-making and measurable business impact. My experience spans predictive modeling, exploratory data analysis, statistical research, and interactive visualization using tools such as Python, SQL, R, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.
Beyond analytics, I bring hands-on expertise in cloud platforms including AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, and GCP, where I design scalable data pipelines, deploy production-ready applications, and implement secure, cost-efficient architectures. This cloud-native mindset allows me to build systems that are not only intelligent, but also reliable and performant in real-world environments.
In AI and machine learning, I focus on practical solutions—developing models that automate processes, uncover hidden patterns, and enhance user experiences. From model training and evaluation to API deployment and monitoring, I understand the full lifecycle of intelligent systems.
As a backend developer, I design and build robust APIs, data-driven services, and high-performance systems using modern frameworks and relational databases. This engineering perspective enables me to bridge the gap between analytical models and production software.
What defines me most is adaptability: the ability to move fluidly between data, infrastructure, and application layers. This blend allows me to solve complex problems end-to-end, delivering solutions that are technically sound, scalable, and aligned with real business needs.

About Me
I am a multidisciplinary technology professional working across data science, analytics, cloud engineering, AI/ML, and backend development, with a strong focus on building systems that move from raw data to real-world impact.
My work spans the entire data and application lifecycle—from data acquisition, cleaning, and exploratory analysis, to machine learning, AI system design, deployment, and backend integration. I specialize in turning unstructured and structured data into decision-ready insights, intelligent automation, and scalable production systems.
On the data side, I work extensively with Python, SQL, and R for statistical analysis, predictive modeling, time series forecasting, and business analytics. I design interactive dashboards and reporting systems using Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit, and Excel, enabling stakeholders to explore performance, trends, and operational drivers with clarity.
In AI and machine learning, my experience includes classical ML, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). I have built and deployed AI systems involving LLM fine-tuning, vector search, agentic workflows, and multimodal document understanding, with a strong emphasis on evaluation, reliability, and production readiness.
From an engineering and cloud perspective, I design and deploy scalable backend services and data pipelines using FastAPI, Django, Flask, Laravel, RESTful APIs, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines. I work comfortably across AWS, Azure, GCP, and IBM Cloud, delivering systems that are secure, maintainable, and aligned with business constraints.
What defines my approach is systems thinking—the ability to connect data, models, infrastructure, and applications into cohesive solutions that solve real problems, not just technical exercises.
